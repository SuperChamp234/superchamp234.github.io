# Zain's Blog
Welcome to my personal blog hosted at [zainsv.me](https://zainsv.me). This is where I share my notes, thoughts, and experiences as I explore the world of technology and beyond.

## About Me
I'm Zain Siddavatam, a student at VJTI Mumbai with a passion for computer architecture and low-level systems. I enjoy learning by building, breaking, and experimenting. Currently, I'm:

- Building a RISC-V CPU to deepen my understanding of computer architecture.
- Exploring ML accelerators and their architectures through research papers.
- Looking for collaborations on impactful research in computer architecture and ML.
- Spending quality time playing hide and seek with my cat.
