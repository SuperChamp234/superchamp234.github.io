# Who even are you?

I'm Zain, currently a student @ VJTI Mumbai. I've been exploring computers and their low level architectures for sometime now, and I'm always looking for new things to learn! Don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat. I'm always up for a good conversation!
