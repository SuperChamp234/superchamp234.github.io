      <p>Celeste is a game that I really like. It's a platformer that's really hard, but it's also really fair. The game is designed in such a way that you can always see what you need to do to progress, and it's just a matter of executing on that. The game also has a really great story that's told through the gameplay, which is something that I really appreciate. It also keep you going by showing you how far you've come, and how much you've improved. It teaches us not to be afraid of failure, but to embrace it as a part of the learning process.</p>
<p>In the game, there is a level where we're supposed to make a feather float and stay inside a box. An ingame character, Theo, introduces it to us in order to calm down. The feather is controlled by the wind, and we have to control it by moving in the opposite direction, breathing in and out.</p>
<p>I would love to climb a mountain like that, overcoming challenges and redefining my limits. I'm proud of Madeleine, the protagonist, for her courage and determination. I hope to be like her one day.</p>
